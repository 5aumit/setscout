# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as GitHub issues. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, including labels.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open` with appropriate label filters.
- **Comment**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`.
- **Apply / remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`.
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`.

Infer the repository from `git remote -v`; `gh` does this automatically when run inside a clone.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** _(Set to `yes` if this repo treats external PRs as feature requests; `/triage` reads this flag.)_

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a GitHub issue.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Run `gh issue view <number> --comments`.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a single issue with child issues as tickets.

- **Map**: a single issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body.
- **Child ticket**: an issue linked to the map as a GitHub sub-issue. Where sub-issues are unavailable, add the child to a task list in the map body and put `Part of #<map>` at the top of the child body.
- **Blocking**: GitHub native issue dependencies. Where unavailable, use a `Blocked by: #<n>, #<n>` line in the issue body; a ticket is unblocked when every listed blocker is closed.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me`.
- **Resolve**: comment with the result, then close the issue.
